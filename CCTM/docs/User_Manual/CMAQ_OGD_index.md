CMAQ Operational Guidance Document: About this manual

This manual is an operational guidance document for users of the CMAQ modeling system, and is designed to support the installation, configuration, and execution of CMAQ on Linux systems. CMAQ users should be familiar with Linux scripting conventions and have some familiarity with the Fortran programming language. Users should also have some familiarity with atmospheric structure, and the physical and chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere.

In brief, the following sections are included in this manual:

[Chapter 1a](CMAQ_OGD_ch01_intro.md) presents the CMAQ concepts, terminology, installation instructions, and guidance on running the tutorial simulation distributed with the model.

[Chapter 1b](unknown) provides information on how to develop the meteorology and emissions for CMAQ present the basic concepts and the availability of models that generate these CMAQ inputs, and describe how to configure these systems to produce input for CMAQ.

[Chapter 2](CMAQ_OGD_ch02_overview.md) provides an overview of CMAQ.

[Chapter 3](CMAQ_OGD_ch03_features.md) provides a list of new and retired features of CMAQ.

[Chapter 4](CMAQ_OGD_ch04_science.md) provides an explanation of the science used in CMAQ.

[Chapter 5](CMAQ_OGD_ch05_sys_req.md) describes computer system requirements and installation.

[Chapter 6](CMAQ_OGD_ch06_req_lib.md) discusses the required libraries including the Input/Output Applications Programming Interface (I/O API) and netCDF.

[Chapter 7](CMAQ_OGD_ch07_programs_libraries.md) describes the CMAQ programs. 

[Chapter 8](CMAQ_OGD_ch08_input_files.md) describes CMAQ input and output files.

[Chapter 9](CMAQ_OGD_ch09_grid_defn.md) discusses how to define modeling grids, vertical layers, and chemical mechanisms.

[Chapter 10](CMAQ_OGD_ch10_new_simulation.md) describes how to set up CMAQ for new simulations.

[Chapter 11](CMAQ_OGD_ch11_code_management.md) provides CMAQ code management and development guidelines.

[Chapter 12](CMAQ_OGD_ch12_analysis_tools.md) describes analysis options for CMAQ output.

[Chapter 13](CMAQ_OGD_ch13_support.md) describes how to obtain support for CMAQ.

[Appendix A](CMAQ_OGD_ch14_appendix.md) describes the CMAQ Chemical Mechanisms and Species

[Glossary](CMAQ_OGD_ch15_glossary.md) contains a list of technical terms and their definitions
